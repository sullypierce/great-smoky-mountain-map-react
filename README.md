## The Great Smoky Mountain Map

This project is a map based React App with a Django REST server-side found at https://github.com/sullypierce/great-smoky-mountain-map-django.  It uses Leaflet and Mapbox to render the map component.  Users can create an account and use the map to place markers anywhere they choose in a map of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  These markers can be made public or private, and used to either leave helpful information for other users to see or keep memories of places you have visited in the park.  The map also includes built in markers from the Hiking Project API (https://www.hikingproject.com/data) that show the trailheads of the most popular hiking trails.
